# Ultimate_Take-Home_Challenge

This is a data analysis challenge from Springboard, as part of the Springboard Data Science curriculum.
In this challenge, Ultimate, a rider service company, is interested in studying patterns of demand for rides
and the prediction of customer retention status. Reported here are the key hours and quarter hours for ridership demand
and the customer information that is useful in predicting whether a customer will use Ultimate's service 5-6 months after signing up.
In addition, suggestions are made for retention of customers.

Code is provided in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.
A written report in the form of a pdf file is also provided. 

Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis 

In ths section, analysis of data consisting of timestamps for logins for the purpose of determing patterns of demand on
a daily and monthly basis is discussed. The number of logins during 60 minute and 15 minute intervals during the day will be analyzed and discussed as well.

Part 2: Experiment and Metrics Design

This part is in the written report where an experiment is proposed to study a metric of succes for a proposal to encourage drivers in two cities to service riders in the other city. There is no code for this part.

Part 3: Predictive Modeling

Predicting which customers will continue to use Ultimate's ride service is the focus of this section.
Machine Learning Classification methods are employed to make predictions of long-term or short-term customer
use of the service. In this project, the XGBoost Classifier gave the best results. Analysis and recommendations for
retaining customers are in the written report.
